# Run Like You Canvas
A simple run & jump canvas game.

### Overview
A simple square (player) runs and tries to jump over obstacles (other squares)
That are coming at the player from the right side of the screen. 
The player can speed up (d or right arrow) or slow down using (a or left arrow)
The player can jump (w or up arrow)
When the player speeds up, the speed at which the obstacles come at the player increases
When the player slows down, the speed at which the obstacles come at the player decreases
Version 1 will have 3 speeds (slow, medium(start speed), fast)
The player will have 3 lives. The player will lose a life each time they hit an obstacle
After the 3rd life is lost, the next one, the game ends
The score will be based off of the distance the player "ran" and the speed at which they ran the course (higher score if same distance but achieved faster)
